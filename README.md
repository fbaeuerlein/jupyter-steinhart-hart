# Fitting NTC data to get Steinhart-Hart coefficients

A Jupyter notebook to fit the Steinhart-Hart equation into a set of measurements (temperature and resistance) to estimate the coefficients accordingly. This could be used for calibration of NTC based thermometers (e.g. for reading the sensor values with an ADC).

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for required packages. For installation simply run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` before running juypter lab/notebook.
